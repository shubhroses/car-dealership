# Development Email Configuration
# 
# To enable email sending in development, uncomment and complete the settings below:
#
# 1. Use a Gmail account (or create one for development purposes)
# 2. Enable "Less secure app access" OR 
# 3. Create an App Password:
#    - Go to https://myaccount.google.com/security
#    - Enable 2-Step Verification if not already enabled
#    - Go to "App passwords" section
#    - Select app: "Mail" and device: "Other (Custom name)" - name it "Car Dealership Dev"
#    - Copy the generated 16-character password
#
# spring.mail.username=your-gmail@gmail.com
# spring.mail.password=your-app-password-here

# In development mode, all emails will be sent to this address regardless of the actual recipient
# This helps prevent accidental emails to real customers during development/testing
app.development.override.email=shubhroses@gmail.com
